    "In this ungraded lab, we will explain the stack semantics in Trax. This will help in understanding how to use layers like `Select` and `Residual` which operates on elements in the stack. If you've taken a computer science class before, you will recall that a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That is, whatever is the latest element that is pushed into the stack will also be the first one to be popped out. If you're not yet familiar with stacks, then you may find this [short tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_stack.htm) useful. In a nutshell, all you really need to remember is it puts elements one on top of the other. You should be aware of what is on top of the stack to know which element you will be popping. You will see this in the discussions below. Let's get started!"

    "To understand how stack-orientation works in [Trax](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), most times one will be using the `Serial` layer. We will define two simple [Function layers](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/layers_intro.html?highlight=fn#With-the-Fn-layer-creating-function.): 1) Addition and 2) Multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to make the simple calculation (3 + 4) * 15 + 3. `Serial` will perform the calculations in the following manner `3` `4` `add` `15` `mul` `3` `add`. The steps of the calculation are shown in the table below. The first column shows the operations made on the stack and the second column the output of those operations. Moreover, the rightmost element in the second column represents the top of the stack (e.g. in the second row, `Push(3)` pushes `3 ` on top of the stack and `4` is now under it).\n",

    "From this, the following can be concluded: a stack-based layer has only one way to handle data, by taking one piece of data from atop the stack, termed popping, and putting data back atop the stack, termed pushing. Any expression that can be written conventionally, can be written in this form and thus be amenable to being interpreted by a stack-oriented layer like `Serial`."
