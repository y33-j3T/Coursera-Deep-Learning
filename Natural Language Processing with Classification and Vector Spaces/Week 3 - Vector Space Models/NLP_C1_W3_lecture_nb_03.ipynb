    "In this lab, we are going to view another explanation about Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA is a statistical technique invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson that uses orthogonal transformations to map a set of variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called Principal Components. \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is based on the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) of the Covariance Matrix of the original dataset. The Eigenvectors of such decomposition are used as a rotation matrix.  The Eigenvectors are arranged in the rotation matrix in decreasing order according to its explained variance. This last term is related to the EigenValues of the SVD.\n",

    "PCA is a potent technique with applications ranging from simple space transformation, dimensionality reduction, and mixture separation from spectral information.\n",

    "Follow this lab to view another explanation for PCA. In this case, we are going to use the concept of rotation matrices applied to correlated random data, just as illustrated in the next picture.\n",
